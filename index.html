            <p><em>&#8764;Barcelona&#8764; Once upon a time Jason wanted to go on a journey, he asked Hera to
                    predict a
                    quiet journey without
                    Many difficulties. Hera, as a good friend of Jason, granted his wish, Jason asked for help from
                    Heracles and Hermes to help him, they took 9 boats because of the difficulties they could find
                    on their way,
                    When they had been traveling for a while, they realized that they were missing a boat. Heracles
                    and
                    Hermes went in search of that boat, after a while, they found that boat docked in a
                    port,
                    Curious about where they had found that boat, they decided to visit that unknown city,
                    they walked through its streets,
                    they met its people... They fell in love with that city so much that they decided
                    call it...<strong>Barcanona</strong>, in honor of the ninth boat that was lost.
