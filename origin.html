    <h1>Origin of Gods</h1>

    <p>The origin of the Greek gods begins with Gea, also known as Gaia, who personified the Earth. Gea emerged from
        Chaos, the formless void at the beginning of creation. She gave birth to Uranus, the personification of the sky,
        who became her companion and the ruler of the heavens.
        Gea and Uranus became the first divine couple and produced a multitude of children, including the Titans,
        Cyclopes, and Hecatoncheires (hundred-handed giants). However, Uranus feared his powerful offspring and
        imprisoned them within Gea's womb, causing her great pain and suffering.</p>

    <p>From the blood of Uranus that fell upon the Earth, several entities were born. Among them were the goddess Nix,
        representing the night, and Erebus, personifying darkness. Nix gave birth to various deities associated with the
        night, such as Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death).Erebus, on the other hand, formed a union with Nyx and
        together they brought forth Aether (Ether), symbolizing the upper atmosphere, and Hemera, representing the day.
        Aether and Hemera introduced light and brightness to the world, countering the darkness of Erebus.</p>

    <p>These primordial deities played significant roles in the Greek pantheon, with Gea being revered as the Earth
        goddess, Uranus as the personification of the sky, Nix as the goddess of the night, Erebo as the embodiment of
        darkness, Eter as the representation of the upper atmosphere, and Hemera as the goddess of the day. Their
        lineage and interactions shaped the narrative of Greek mythology, laying the foundation for the subsequent
        generations of gods and goddesses.</p>
