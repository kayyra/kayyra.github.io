# Aetherios-1
Day 05/29/2023,  we are assigned the Tribute project in pairs, in this project we were asked to pay tribute to someone or something.

<h1 align="center">Welcome to Aetherios </h1>
<p>Project that was done in pairs, we were talking and agreeing on what to pay tribute to or to whom,
We both found that apart from having a lot in common, Greek mythology is what could give us the most play, so
we decided to make it about Greek mythology and pay tribute to it.</p>
